Input: Cost matrix C[n][n]

Step 1: Develop the Cost Matrix
  If the matrix is not square:
    Add dummy rows/columns with zero cost to make it square

Step 2: Find the Opportunity Cost Matrix
  For each row:
    Subtract the minimum value of that row from all elements in that row
  For each column:
    Subtract the minimum value of that column from all elements in that column

Step 3: Make Assignments
  While not all assignments are made:
    (a) First Round:
      For each row with exactly one zero:
        Assign (mark ☐), cross off (×) other zeros in the same column
      For each column with exactly one zero:
        Assign (mark ☐), cross off (×) other zeros in the same row

    (b) Second Round:
      For any unassigned rows/columns with multiple zeros:
        Arbitrarily assign one zero, cross off others

Step 4: Check Optimality
  If number of assignments == number of rows (or columns):
    Stop — Optimal assignment found
  Else:
    Go to Step 5

Step 5: Revise Opportunity Cost Matrix
  Mark (✓) rows without an assignment
  Repeat:
    For each marked row:
      If it has a zero, mark corresponding column
    For each marked column:
      If it has an assigned zero, mark corresponding row
  Until no new rows/columns are marked
  Draw lines through all unmarked rows and marked columns

  If number of lines == n:
    Stop — Optimal solution found
  Else:
    Go to Step 6

Step 6: Develop New Revised Cost Matrix
  Let k = minimum uncovered element (not crossed by any line)
  For each element in uncovered cells:
    Subtract k
  For each element at intersection of two lines:
    Add k
  All other elements remain unchanged

Step 7: Repeat
  Go to Step 3 until optimal assignment is obtained
